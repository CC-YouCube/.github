## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, please do the following:

- Do **not** open a public issue.
- Create a ticket on [Discord](https://discord.gg/j6MatB3AbH) and send a message with a description of the vulnerability and any related information (e.g. reproduction steps) to the ticket.

Our security team will acknowledge your message and send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.

We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been fixed. This gives us time to patch the vulnerability and to ensure that any affected users are notified of the issue.
